Hello adventurer and welcome to the dorm scavenger hunt!

On this hunt you must find the hidden treasure which is concealed in one of the rooms. You may be wondering how you will be able to find it with all of these rooms, but luckily we have a few functions to help! If you run dorm.py it will reveal which dorm to go to and if you run num.py it will reveal which room the treasure is in. Once you have found the treasure, add something fun to your own room (anything except the treasure of course). Good luck on your adventure!

* Extra credit to whoever can tell Prof Dodds the name of the student who lived in the room with the treasure from 2024-2025!
